<h2>Copyright Exclusion</h2>
In addition to the terms above, Sentry has an addition Copyright term to increase usability.<br/><br/>
Sentry is designed as a Framework for writing and releasing Games built in a platform independent context. Applications which Build Sentry or a subset framework into there core are considered a Derivative Work, and therefore are bound by the Terms of the GNU General Public License. 
However, Games which are developed using Sentry Game Engine, which DO NOT build Sentry into the product are exempt from these terms, and are not considered Derivative Works. This is based on the linking exception of GNU GPL. The use of the library itself is still bound by GPL. 
This specific Exception applies to all works which use Sentry Game Engine in the way shown above, even if it would otherwise be termed a Derivative Work under The GNU GPL. <br/><br/>
Despite this explicit exemption, the spirit of Sentry is that users are free to build upon other's works to improve them. We encourage developers to release there Games under GNU GPL or other Freeware licenses, rather then releasing proprietary games.
