/**
 * Contains classes that are used to store copies of the game state so that it could be reverted.
 * 
 * This package, and all of the classes contained in it are deprecated as of Phase 4 of the Sentry Codebase Transition,
 *  for many reasons.<br/>
 * The primary reason is that the types basically served no purpose, except indicating that the operations can be performed,
 *  no actual attempts to store, copy, or rollback the state of a program.<br/>
 * It would be equally as easy, and in most cases, more efficient, for case-specific alternatives to be used instead.
